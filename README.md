# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
A case study for the already existing SER framework, proposed in https://github.com/IliaZenkov/transformer-cnn-emotion-recognition.

In this study the following tests and setups have been done on the framework proposed by Ilia Zenkov:

1. Trying to recreate his results on the RAVDESS dataset.
2. Training and testing a model on the IEMOCAP dataset. This is done for comparison reasons.
3. Training a model on the RAVDESS dataset but testing it on the IEMOCAP dataset. The goal is to make an approach if these kinds of SER models can make sense in real world applications.
4. Training a model on the IEMOCAP dataset but testing it on the RAVDESS dataset. This is also done for comparison reasons.
